use make to create the two executables. 
then to use server use:
	./server ./cert.pem ./key.pem port 

it will ask for a PEM pass. The Pem Pass is:
			acarden1
then to use client use:
	./client hostname port

it will ask for a number right after connecting and then give it a number. The server will then take that number and write the number +1 which the client will take. 

after the cloent closes the connection the server will close the connection.
To end the client program enter zero for the number
